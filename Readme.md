## BACKUP YOUR SAVE FILES & EXE FILES!

Change your command menu style to "classic" in the options menu.
This will move P1's command menu higher up to work better with the horizontal screen setting.

### Installation

Drop zmulti into your ~mods folder, this contains all files needed for Multiplayer.

### Controls:

P - Toggle PvP mode.
O - Temporarily change P1 into Sora
U - Toggle Multiplayer Mode

1 - Teleport to P1 
2 - Teleport to P2


##### In Character Select Screen:

Q, E, R1, R2 - Change costumes

Start/M - Start (when both characters have been selected)


### Known Issues:

  Currently, Olympus doesn't support multiplayer due to controller class dependancies.

  There have been reports that some bosses may crash the game, or not work as intended.

  Sometimes, ReMind save files don't seem to load properly.

  Some areas may not initialise P2's health in P1's ally slot properly. If this happens, a quick fix is to toggle multiplayer off and back on with "U".

  Enemy Health UI may sometimes not display properly.

  Some mods may not be compatible. If facing errors, try removing mods first!


-These are, of course, being looked into. Just things to note when trying the current version.
